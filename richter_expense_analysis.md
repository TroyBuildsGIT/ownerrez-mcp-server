## üìã **SUMMARY**

**The Richter property expenses are inflated by incorrectly classified items:**

- **Airbnb payments** ($17,023) classified as expenses but are actually **booking revenue**
- **Internal transfers** ($13,000+) are **personal money movements**
- **Credit refunds** ($2,505) are **income, not expenses**

**Real monthly business expenses should be ~$5,500-7,000, not $17,872!**

This correction would show Richter as a **highly profitable property** with realistic expenses and strong cash flow, rather than the current inflated expense picture.
